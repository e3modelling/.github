# Welcome

E3-Modelling is a société anonyme (S.A.) company, established in Greece, as a knowledge-intensive consulting company. We deliver consulting services based on the large-scale empirical modelling of the economy-energy-environment nexus: PRIMES, GEM-E3 and Prometheus. We focus on the design of transition in the energy market and systems, both demand and supply of energy, towards green and climate-friendly structures and technologies. With the modelling, we help to assess the transitions from economic, policy and implementation perspectives putting emphasis on the functioning of the system and the markets as a whole when policy instruments influence behaviours and market outcomes
